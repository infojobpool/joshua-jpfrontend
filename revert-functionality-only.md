# Revert Functionality Changes Only (Keep UI Changes)

## Changes to REVERT (Functionality Issues):

### 1. Remove excessive debugging logs
- Remove all the console.log statements I added
- Keep only essential error logging

### 2. Revert API timeout changes
- Change timeouts back to original values (10s, 15s)
- Remove the aggressive 5s timeouts

### 3. Remove request deduplication complexity
- Remove the localStorage request flags
- Simplify the useEffect dependencies

### 4. Revert caching complexity
- Remove shared cache logic
- Keep simple localStorage caching

### 5. Remove circuit breaker from dashboard
- Keep it only in axiosInstance.tsx

## Changes to KEEP (UI Improvements):

### 1. Button styling improvements
- Keep all the enhanced button CSS classes
- Keep loading spinners and hover effects

### 2. Text changes
- Keep "Task completed successfully" text
- Keep removed "Completed: Unknown" text

### 3. Visual enhancements
- Keep all the gradient backgrounds
- Keep hover animations and transitions

## Quick Fix:
1. Keep the NotificationBar changes (CRITICAL - these fixed the main performance issue)
2. Keep the axiosInstance circuit breaker
3. Keep the admin polling reductions
4. Revert dashboard complexity back to simpler version
5. Keep all UI styling improvements

The main performance fix was the NotificationBar optimization - that's what solved the database connection exhaustion issue.
